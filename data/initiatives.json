Measure 1 would be a big leap forward.",

    "description": "The future of prescription drug costs in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off? \n\nProposition 61 would require that the State of California pay no more for prescription drugs than what’s paid for by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, which is allowed to negotiate drug prices. This initiative would save California taxpayers billions of dollars and open the floodgates to similar initiatives around the country—and Big Pharma knows it. \n\nBig drug companies plan to spend $100 million in misleading ads to defeat this measure, because it would put a serious dent in their price gouging. The fact is, for years, drug companies have been more focused on making huge profits than on developing new medication, which is why they spend far more on marketing than research—expenses that they pass on directly to consumers and taxpayers. \n\nSo far, elected officials have been unable or unwilling to take action to lower drug costs. Proposition 61 lets the people of California do it themselves.",

    "vote": "Yes",
    "description": "If we are serious about restoring our democracy, we need to radically transform our campaign finance laws. \n\nInitiated Measure 22 would extensively address the issue of money in politics by holding politicians and lobbyists accountable. It would impose limits on contributions from PACs and campaign committees, requiring additional financial disclosures and creating an ethics commission to enforce campaign finance laws. The measure would create a publicly funded campaign finance program, allowing grassroots-supported candidates to fundraise competitively and limiting the influence of big money. The measure would also prohibit certain public officials from lobbying until two years after they leave their government position and place limitations on lobbyists’ gifts to state officials.",

    "vote": "No",
    "description": "South Dakotans voted overwhelmingly for a minimum wage increase in 2014—a vote that Referred Law 20 (RL 20) would undercut by creating a “youth sub-minimum wage” for workers under 17 years old. \n\nRL 20 not only engages in a form of economic discrimination itself, it also opens the door to future age-based discrimination, including against the elderly. Legislators should not be able to overturn the will of the people by targeting vulnerable groups, like working teenagers who are unable to cast a ballot themselves. It is our responsibility to protect the next generations' rights and invest in their well-being. \n\nAt a time when middle-class wages have been stagnant for decades, we should be raising the minimum wage, not decreasing it.",

    "vote": "Yes",
    "description": "Voters should be choosing their politicians, but unfortunately, due to the biased process in which voting maps are drawn, it’s often politicians who choose their voters. When state legislators have the power to decide which voters are designated to particular voting districts, the result is often gerrymandering—maps are drawn to favor the incumbents and/or the party in charge.\n\nAmendment T would address this by replacing the legislators on the map-drawing committee with voters—a move which not only reduces the bias in the process, but also saves taxpayer dollars. \n\nCommittee members would not be allowed to hold public office 3 years before or after being selected and would ban the use of party identification to manipulate maps. The ultimate result is a fairer redistricting process and a healthier democracy.",

    "description": "Virginia currently has a right-to-work statute that is designed to weaken unions and, by effect, lower worker wages. The “Right to Work” Amendment would add right-to-work regulations to the Virginia Constitution to make these right-to-work regulations harder to change in the future. \n\nAttempts like these to codify legislation in the state constitution are little more than blatant attempts to shield legislators from having to debate and defend their positions. The reality is that right-to-work laws take away workers’ rights and drive down wages—that’s why billionaires like the Koch brothers heap millions in campaign donations to get them passed. \n\nLegislators need to be held accountable for their positions, especially when they stand against working families. That’s why we need to stop Virginia’s “Right to Work” Amendment in its tracks.",

    "description": "Initiative 1433 (I-1433), the Washington Minimum Wage Increase, would and mandate employers to offer paid sick leave and raise Washington’s minimum wage to $13.50 by 2020. \n\nWe can't grow our economy and create new jobs if people don't have enough money to buy products made and sold in their communities. Raising the minimum wage to a living wage is basic economic sense, and it leads to more productive workers, as well.\n\nAlmost every industrialized nation guarantees some sort of paid sick leave—with the United States being the exception. Not only is unethical to not guarantee paid sick leave to low wage workers, it creates an immense public health issue. I-1433 would help Washington lead the nation in taking a huge step forward for workers’ rights.",
