When Irvin was eleven, his family moved out of California and across the country to a little town called Springdale. They were looking for a safer community, a better education for their children, and their shot at living the American dream. What they found was a place they could call home. Irvin started the 6th grade at J.O. Kelly Middle School. It was in his time at Springdale Public Schools that he first became an activist, getting involved with the Arkansas Natural DREAMers and becoming their Lead Coordinator, a position he held for five years. Irvin has collaborated with the United Community Coalition, chairing their iDREAM campaign, and helped organize more than a dozen DACA clinics around the state. He is a frequent volunteer for other social justice organizations.",

My calling into the greater progressive movement started at the age of 11 when I was inspired by my 6th grade teacher to speak out and say no to the burning of crosses and the Ku Klux Klan. Since that moment I have felt a flame of social justice burning from inside, pushing me to do what I can to make this world a better, safer, and more just place.\n\nI did not get into politics because I think it is fun, like reading polls or watching the horse race. I got into politics because I had no other choice. Sitting on the sidelines while powerful interest have all but eliminated the middle class, while they destroy our environment, while they lock-up our people has never been an option for me.\n\nIf elected to the Black Hawk County Board of Supervisors I will put the interest of the people first. Human rights, civil rights, worker's rights, and environmental protection are the values that will serve as my compass for every vote I take as a member of the Black Hawk County Board of Supervisors.\n\nWe need to build a local movement here in Black Hawk County to raise the minimum wage, reform our criminal justice system, protect worker's rights, improve public health, and protect our environment. With a lot of hard work and a little bit of imagination we can build that movement.\" - Chris Schwartz",

Gary believes that today, those values are corroding as too many in America have been successfully marginalizing the Middle Class, the American worker, the environment, affordable education, and compassionate service. Too many Americans would rather continue foreign policy directives that serve to create more enemies rather than lasting peace, and as the father of two young sons, I am driven to change this course.

In addition to being the sitting Vice President of the Long Beach City Council, Anthony is also a proud third-generation union member, a little league coach, a husband, and a father of two. Anthony was first elected to the Long Beach City Council in 2013, where he has lead the city’s efforts to recover after Superstorm Sandy, balanced the city’s budget, and fought to preserve good jobs and a strong quality of life for families and seniors. As a full time field technician with Verizon, Anthony has also been a proud member of the Communication Workers of America for the past two decades and currently serves as Chief Steward of CWA Local 1106. He previously served CWA Local 1104 as Political Director & Shop Steward. He and his wife Jen, the Director of Development for Planned Parenthood of Nassau County, reside in Long Beach’s West End. In his own words: “Growing up, Long Island really was the culmination of the American Dream, where hard work, family and great neighbors meant a quality of life you could count on. Now, it feels like all of that’s being taken away and we need real leadership in Albany to fight back by bringing in good jobs, easing the property tax burden and getting the South Shore our fair share.”",

Unbalanced trade deals and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas have put people out of work. College is unaffordable for many young adults, and rising student loan debt makes it difficult for them to open businesses, buy houses, and start families. Seniors worry about their retirement security as politicians in Washington threaten to reduce retirement benefits.

    "bio": "Chase Iron Eyes was raised on the Standing Rock Reservation where he learned the value of education and hard work from his single, working-poor, mother. Chase also learned a great deal about sacrifice from spending his youth around an entrepreneur who worked from sun-up to sun-down running his own local gas-station, growing his own garden, and raising his own livestock. Chase spent several summers hauling and stacking square bales, branding calves, and pumping gas at the local fill-station. Chase has held a job since he was 14 years old. He went to work for a minimum wage of $4.25 per hour because he knew his mother could only afford school clothes for his younger brother that year and the years following. He wants to bridge small-town values with the global impact that North Dakota should have in the United States and in the world. Chase believes whole-heartedly in local talent, entrepreneurship, values, sacrifice, patriotism, common sense and duty to the land and waters of our States and Country. We must leave an economy that our great grandchildren can inherit and make a living from. Chase Iron Eyes is married to Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle and they have three children. Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle was a partner in a private medical practice in Bismarck, ND before the family moved back to the Standing Rock reservation where Dr. Jumping Eagle oversees the delivery of medical care at the Indian Health Service hospital. Dr. Jumping Eagle graduated from Stanford School of Medicine and is board certified in North Dakota. Chase graduated from the University of North Dakota earning a bachelor’s degree in 2000 with a double major in Political Science and Native American Studies. Chase finished his legal training at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law in 2007. Having served as in-house counsel to various Tribal Nations in the Northern Plains since gaining admission to the South Dakota Bar, he went into private practice in 2011. Since moving back to the small town of Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation, he has focused his efforts on helping people recover from the imposed poverty culture and all of its symptoms evident on any reservation in America. This has led him to lead a petition drive to rewrite the Tribal Constitution to empower communities and people to determine their own destiny with self-sufficiency. Chase has also worked hard to create a private homeowner culture on the Reservation.",

She was also involved with pursuing and reinforcing the rights of diabled citizens, such as the deaf and university students in their quest for a more democratic and affordable education.\n\nYulin was elected as Mayor of San Juan on 2012. Her election was the result of a grass roots effort which united in an unprecedented alliance groups which have traditionally been excluded from the democratic process. During her tenure Yulin has proven to be a friend of labor making San Juan the first and only municipality in Puerto Rico where employees have the right to collective bargaining; citizen participation has been at the core of her administration as San Juan has become the first place in Puerto Rico to pioneer participatory budgeting. Under Mayor Yulin Cruz the municipality has taken steps to begin a change torwards a municipal version of universal health plan and culture and sports are widely used as a tool for economic and social development. At the forefront of her personal struggles are the release of political prisioner Oscar Lopez Rivera and the dredging of El Caño Martin Peña an impoverished area of San Juan where 27,000 people feel the injustice of lacking a proper sewer system which keeps them from reaching their highest community potential. A firm believer that \"the power is in the streets\" Yulin strives to seek alliances to empower people and ensure an agenda of prosperity and social justice.",

However, when he was sixteen, Adam’s mother was run over by a car and died. He couldn’t afford to go to college; so he worked a number of different jobs in restaurants, retail stores, and factories to pay the bills and put food on the table. He knows personally the fear of working paycheck to paycheck and the labor of having to work several low paying jobs just to make ends meet.",

Pelkey also pledges to work toward closing the growing wage gap between men and women in Wyoming.\n\n“I am embarrassed to say that Wyoming holds the distinction of having the largest wage gap between men and women in the United States. That has to change.”\n\nCharles Pelkey is a local attorney who made a career switch after 25 years as a journalist. Before becoming a lawyer, Pelkey worked as a radio and television host, a newspaper reporter, press secretary in the U.S. Senate and magazine editor.\n\nIn July of 2011 Pelkey found he was one of those rare men to be diagnosed with breast cancer. (He’s since learned that one-percent of all breast cancer cases occur in men.)\n\n“Obviously, it’s not what I wanted,” said Pelkey, “but it proved to be something of a learning experience. I lost my magazine job – where I had my health insurance – and got confirmation of my diagnosis on the very same day. I was facing the loss of health coverage at the most critical moment in my life. I was fortunate in being able to negotiate continued coverage, but it made me painfully aware of the whole issue of health care costs, health coverage and the risk of financial disaster, simply because someone unexpectedly falls ill. As an attorney, I’ve helped guide several Wyoming citizens through the process of bankruptcy, a difficult choice they faced solely due to crushing health care debt. That has to change.”\n\nToday Pelkey works as an attorney at one of Laramie’s most successful law firms dedicated to protecting and promoting the rights of Wyoming Citizens. He is an active member of the community, and pledges to fight for the future of Laramie families.",
