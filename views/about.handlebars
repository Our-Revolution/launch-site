The Board shall take an active role in furthering the goals and purposes of the Corporation and Directors are encouraged and expected to be active advocates for the Corporation’s goals. The Board may delegate the management of the activities of the Corporation to any person or persons, or committee however composed, provided the activities and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction, and subject to the oversight, of the Board.</p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.02.	</b><i><b>Number of Directors; Qualifications. </i></b>The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three (3) or more than thirteen (13) members. The maximum number of directors may be changed by an amendment to the Bylaws, but any such amendment shall not affect the tenure of office of any director, except as provided in Section 5.04. Directors need not be residents of the District of Columbia. A person must be a Member of the Organization in accordance with Section 4.01 above in order to serve as a Director on the Board of Directors. </p>

        <p>(B)  The terms of the directors shall be staggered. The initial Board members shall be divided into three approximately equal classes (A, B, and C).  As decided in more detail by resolution of the Board, Class A shall serve an initial term ending at the 2018 annual meeting, Class B shall serve an initial term ending at the 2019 annual meeting, and Class C shall serve an initial term ending at the 2020 annual meeting.

        <p>(D) A committee of the Board shall be responsible for nominating a slate of prospective Board members representing the Corporation’s diverse community. In addition, any member of the Board can nominate a candidate to the slate of nominees during the annual meeting of the Board of Directors. Each Director shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected and until the election and qualification of a successor, or until that Director’s earlier resignation or removal in accordance with these Bylaws.</p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.04.	</b><i><b>Removal or Resignation of Director. </i></b>Unless the Nonprofit Act provides otherwise, the Board of Directors may remove any director, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the members of the Board of Directors then in office. A director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect on the date the notice was delivered to the Secretary, unless another date is specified in the notice of resignation. No acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. </p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.05.	</b><i><b>Vacancy on Board</i></b><b>. </b>A majority of the remaining directors may at any time fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from any cause. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the unexpired term of the director whose resignation or removal created the vacancy on the Board. If the number of Directors then in office is less than a quorum, additional directors may be elected to fill such vacancies by (i) the unanimous written consent of the Directors then in office, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors in office at a meeting held according to notice, or (iii) a sole remaining Director.</p>
        <p>  </p>
        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.06.	</b><i><b>Annual and Regular Meetings</i></b><b>. </b>The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its Board of Directors for the election of directors and officers and the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting. Except as may be  determined by the Board of Directors, the annual meeting shall be held during the second quarter of the Corporation’s fiscal year at such place and at such time as determined by the Board of Directors. The Corporation will hold other regular meetings at such times as are affixed by the Board of Directors. Unless the Articles of Incorporation, the Nonprofit Act, or these Bylaws provide otherwise, any business may be considered at the annual or any other regular meeting without such business having been specified in the notice for such meeting. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation's existence or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts.</p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.07.	</b><i><b>Special Meetings</i></b><b>. </b>The Chair or any two (2) directors may call a special meeting of the Board of Directors at any time.

Notice is given to a director when: it is delivered personally to the director, left at the director’s residence or usual place of business, or sent by facsimile or e-mail, at least 48 hours before the time of the meeting; or, in the alternative, by U.S. mail to the director’s address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation, at least seven (7) days before the time of the meeting.<b> </b>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may affix a schedule of regular meetings of the Board in advance, which schedule shall constitute due notice of each such regular meeting until such time as the Board changes the schedule of regular meetings. Attendance at a meeting of the Board of Directors shall constitute a waiver of notice, except where a Director states that he or she is attending solely for the purpose of objecting to the conduct of business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. </p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.09.	</b><i><b>Action by Directors. </i></b>Unless the Articles of Incorporation, the Nonprofit Act or these Bylaws require a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present when the vote is taken shall constitute action of the Board of Directors. A majority of the Board of Directors in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a meeting cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present, when any business may be transacted that may have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. </p>

        <p>(B) If D.C. Nonprofit Act § 29-406.21 (or successor section(s)) is amended to permit action by written consent by less than unanimous consent of the Directors, then this section shall be automatically amended, without any action required by the Board of Directors, to permit written action by less than unanimous consent of the Directors, to the fullest extent consistent with such amended section(s).</p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.11.	</b><i><b>Meeting by Electronic Means</i></b><b>. </b>Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear one another, speak and vote on any matters put before the Board.

        <p><b>	SECTION 5.12.	</b><i><b>No</i></b><b> </b><i><b>Compensation. </i></b>The Corporation shall not pay any compensation to any director for services rendered to the Corporation as a director or as an officer, except that a director may be reimbursed for reasonable and customary expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties to the Corporation, in reasonable amounts as approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. </p>

        <p>	<b>SECTION 5.13.	</b><i><b>Attendance at Meetings</i></b>. If any director has four (4) or more absences from regular meetings (which may include an annual meeting) in any twelve-month period, such absences shall constitute a resignation from the Board of Directors by such director.</p>

        <p><b>	SECTION 8.02</b>  	<i><b>Additional Indemnification</i></b>. </p>

        <p>(A) The Corporation shall indemnify an officer or director who is a party to a proceeding because he or she is or was an officer or director against liability incurred in the proceeding if the individual:</p>

        <p>(1)  Acted in good faith;</p>
        <p>(2)  Reasonably believed:</p>

        <p>(C) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, in itself, determinative that the officer or director did not meet the standard of conduct contained in this Section 8.02. </p>

        <p>(D) Unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Corporation may not indemnify an officer or director if such indemnification is otherwise prohibited by law.<b> </b></p>

        <h1>Founding Statement of Our Revolution Board of Directors</h1>
        <h4>September 7, 2016</h4>
        <p>"We are all honored to be members of the Board of Directors of Our Revolution, inspired by Bernie Sanders and his historic presidential campaign. The campaign was always about the movement we were building, as well as supporting a truly amazing candidate.</p>

        <p>We are all volunteers in Our Revolution, as we were in the campaign, and we are honored to be on the front lines with tens of thousands of volunteers and millions of supporters. The launch of Our Revolution was viewed by more than 400,000 of us, including more than 60,000 who attended the 2,600 events.</p>

        <p>We are committed to the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Great groups</strong> — We pledge to support the diversity of the groups and networks that made Bernie 2016 unique.  We will not all agree on everything, but we will work towards unity on many things.</li>
          <li><strong>Great causes</strong> — We will support movements organizing around the critical issues facing us. Sometimes these issue campaigns will stretch out for months or years, like the campaign to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  But we are also prepared to seize the moment, supporting campaigns like the fight against the Dakota Access Bakken pipeline in North Dakota and Iowa.</li>
          <li><strong>Great candidates and ballot measures</strong> — We will back candidates in primaries and general elections.  We will back ballot measures that help create a 21st century democracy and help get big money out of politics, as well as other issues that promote racial, environmental and economic justice.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We are all committed to Bernie’s bold progressive agenda. We are committed to conducting state-based outreach and political strategies. We are committed to leadership diversity, not only for this board, but in our staffing and leadership at all levels. We are committed to democratic decision-making, transparency, political independence and small-dollar fundraising."</p>
