        <h2>California Proposition 59: Overturn Citizens United</h2>

        <p>Our Revolution supports a YES on â€œThe Overturn Citizens United Act, Prop 59", which would urge a federal constitutional amendment that makes clear that corporations should not have the same constitutional rights as human beings and asserts the people's right to fully regulate or limit campaign contributions and spending.</p>

        <p>The measure would instruct California's elected officials "to use all of their constitutional authority" to pass and ratify a federal constitutional amendment that would "overturn Citizens United and other applicable judicial precedents."</p>
